DAC-based audio sample playback is a single channel, represented as
8-bit unsigned integers. This is represented on the sox command line
by the following parameters:

	"-t raw -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned-integer"

The sample rate is derived from the 15700 Hz Horizontal Sync signal,
and in Farhrfall that rate is divided by four. This yields a 3925 Hz
sample rate, represented by the following sox command line parameter:

	"-r 3925"

Converting a WAV to a block of binary audio data with sox:

	sox high-score.wav -t raw -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned-integer -r 3925 \
		high-score.dat

And how to convert form the binary audio data back to WAV:

	sox -t raw -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned-integer -r 3925 high-score.dat \
		high-score.wav

Conversion in either direction can also have any other available and
appropriate sox transformations (e.g. volume adjustment) applied.

Other utilities from the sox suite use the same command line
parameters. This allows you to playback or even record audio data
directly to the desired format:

	play -t raw -c 1 -b 8 -e unsigned-integer -r 3925 high-score.dat
